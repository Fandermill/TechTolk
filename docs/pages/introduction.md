## What is TechTolk?

TechTolk is a .NET localization library with an extensible set of sources and 
translation rendering features. It loads translations sets into memory, registered
by a simple to use API.

## Why TechTolk?

... todo ...

- Multiple sources (resx, hard coded, json, ...)
- Merging multiple sources into one set
- Extensible (source, render)

## Try TechTolk

Want to try TechTolk, but don't want to change all your translation calls in your
views? There is a additional library that you can use as a drop in for .NET's
localization implementation. See [TODO_LINK](#try-techtolk) for more information.
