
# Getting Started

It requires a few steps to get started with TechTolk. First you have to configure 
TechTolk with your DI container and specify which dividers you will support. 
You also have to configure translation sets from which the translation values will 
be returned. You can then use an ITolk<T>, where <T> corresponds to a translation set,
by injecting it into your constructors and calling .Translate("key") where you need it.
